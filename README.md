# Small-Projects
This is the repository that contains smaller projects that do not require their own repo but i would like to be included on my github


-----AS A DISCLAMER-----:
There are many bit of code in this project that are not my own, these include some executables, imports and such.
These should be fairly obvious.
An example being "XboxKeyboardMouse-master", 
I did not make this, if there are any issues, please let me know and i will remove the relevant parts
Thanks :)


-----Projects include-----:


- Mosh HTML:
These are all of the files related to me taking the HTML and CSS course created by "programming with mosh"
on youtube. I believe the video has since been deleted/privated


- PawnTakesPawn:
This was an online marketing event for the game "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War"
This event included many puzzel that needed to be solved in order to get to the next step
During this event i made several python tools to help solve these puzzels, including:
 - spelling mistake solver
 - anagram solver
 - word finder
 - "you may know some letters but not the word length or position of said letters"
and a couple more


- Learning Packets:
This is some programming I did in extension of one my university modules to learning more
about UDP Clients and Server packets


- Puzzel Drawer:
My recreation of a puzzle i saw in a game which has the user find the starting point of the arrows
as quickly as possible.

We competed in Reply Challenge 2020


- Threads:
This is some programmining i did in order to learn about threads so that i was able to use it in 
a lighting program to have multiple different effect running at once without clashing.


- Game poker bot:
This is some programming i did that plays poker autonomously inside of the game GTA V on console
It does this Scraping the screen to get the current cards and the dealers cards.
It then makes a decision and uses keyboard inputs to make a decision.
Very simple and does not perform well, but is a good proof on concept that can be improved upon in the future
